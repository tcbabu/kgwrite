1. A NOTE ON ENCRIPTION
$SE

$SH2 l
1.1 Symmetric Key Encryption
$SE

$SP
There is no confusion about encryption, it is a method of
coding the text so that people who has unauthorized access to the text
will not be able to comprehend the text (hopefully). Generally a secret
code (string) is used to encrypt the text. A simple example is an
'exclusive or' the text with the secret string. As we know we can just
have an 'exclusive or' again on the converted string with the secret
code to get back the original text. This is s very simple method of encryption
and one can have more complex ones.
It is to be noted that, if an encrypted message/text is
send, the receiver should know the secrete code to decrypt the text.
So there must be a way for the receiver to get the secret code.
Anybody who have access to the secret code (string) can decode the
encrypted text. People may even try a brute force method to arrive at the
secrete code.  The risk of brute force attack can be reduced by
frequently changing the secret code.
$SE

$SH2 l
1.2 Public Key/Private key Encryption
$SE

$SP
Since long people thought about a way of encryption method, with two
keys, one for encrypting and another for decrypting, so that once
encrypted with a key, you need the second key to decrypt it. In this
scheme, one key can be distributed to all senders as public key and the
second key, the private key, kept as secret by the receiver and it is
not known to others. The present method to arrive at these keys pair is
based on difficulty in arriving the integer factors of large integer
numbers. Under this scheme there is no need for the sender to know
the private key and knowledge of the public key will not help
in decrypting the coded message. One disadvantage as of now is,it is more
CPU intensive than the first method and generally used to authenticate
the person and then arrive at a secrete string and communicate further.
This is the scheme used in 'ssh'.
$SE

$SH2 l
1.3 CA Certificates
$SE

$SP
Since public-keys are distributed freely, it may be required
to verify that it is really from the original supplier. CA certification
is a method to that end, and known public keys are signed by well known
agencies to build a confidence on the public keys.
$SE

$SH2 l
1.4 Hashing
$SE

$SP
Another concept related to this subject is hashing a file, though it is
not encrypting. Hashing is a method to uniquely arrive at a string/code
from a file. Though one can not get back a file from its hash, it can be
used to check the integrity of a file. Different files always make
different hash string and creating new hash string and comparing with
a previous hash string can be used to check the integrity of a file.

2. ABOUT CONNECTING THROUGH SSH/SCP.
$SE

$SP
To ssh/scp in batch mode (ie without password prompt), following
steps are required.(This is only possible if the remote is configured
to support this authentication.)

$SL
!%1. .ssh directory in $(HOME). It should not have write permission
for others. ie it must be chmod 755
$SE
$l
ie;
$f27
$tc01
   cd ~
   mkdir .ssh
   chmod 755 .ssh
$tc15
$f24

Now under .ssh, run

$f27
$tc01
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
$tc15
$f24

$SP
It will prompt for passphrase, which can be empty, otherwise
it will be prompted for at use also.
Passphrase is a mechanism to encrypt the private key, so that
even if somebody got access to it, the passphrase is needed
to use it. The problem with it is that, it will create problem
in automated mode, so may be avoided in such cases.
$SE

   It will create two files
$o25
$SL
   1. !%id_rsa  which is private key and should not be shared with others,
other than extra ordinary situations. Only the owner should
have permissions on this.
$SE
      ie it must be !c01!f27'chmod 600 id_rsa'!c15!f24.
$SL
  2. !%id_rsa.pub the public key which can be shared with others
but must have  only read permissions to others.
$SE
     ie !c01!f27'chmod 644 id_rsa.pub'!c15!f24
$o10

$SP
  The third file of importance is 'authorized_keys' which also must
only have read permissions for others.
ie !c01!f27'chmod 644 authorized_keys'!c15!f24. This file is a collection of
public keys of others who are allowed to login to the user/machine.
One can certainly add own public key to this file so it is possible to
ssh to own machine/account.
$SE
$l
  ie !c01!f27'cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys'.!c15!f24
$SP
  One can add  public keys of others/machines like this to allow logins
from other users/machines to the account in the machine.
Always remember about the permissions on the files.
$SP
  Forth file is known_hosts. Initially one can just touch it.
It must also be !c01!f27' touch known_hosts;chmod 644 known_hosts'.!c15!f24
'known_hosts' will get build up on making ssh to other
user/machine.
$SP
  If one need access to an account in a machine he has to append his
public key to the authorized_keys of that account and also need to copy
the public key of that account to own authorized keys.
$SE
$l
  Permissions of these files should be as mentioned.

3. ABOUT USAGE OF GIT
$SE

$SH2 l
3.1 General Description
$SE
$SP
Git is a version control system which can have remote locations which
can be used by others to get copy/clone of the repository.
$SE
$SP
If you are just starting your first git repository you
may need to issue the following setup.
$SE

$f27
$tc01
  git config --global user.name "Your user name"
  git config --global user.emal "your email"
$tc15
$f24

$SP
If you need to create a git repository of a project/files, the following
steps are the basic commands.
$SE

$o15
$SL
1. !%Either you create or new directory or an existing one with the required
project related files.
$SE
$SL
2. !%Go to the directory and issue
!c01!f27git init!c15!f24
$SL
3. !%git got a concept of 'branches' to maintain different versions or
stages of a project. The default branch is 'master'. There are ways
to create new branches, delete branches, merge branches. With
!c01!f27'git init'!c15!f24 one created by default the 'master' branch and by default moved to
that branch.
$SE
$o25
$SB
    The next step is adding files and folders to the repository.
!c01!f27'git add <file>/<folder> <file> ....' !c15!f24will add files/folders
to the the current branch, ie to begin with 'master'.
If everything needs to be added one can use;
!c01!f27'git add .'!c15!f24
$SE
$o15

$SL
4. !%Adding alone is not sufficient, one need to commit it.
ie , !c01!f27'git commit -a -m "<info string>"!c15!f24.
'-a' flag is to commit all changes made to the files in the
repository. If you don't do this the changes will not be
reflected. If one has created new files/folders it will not
be reflected in the repository unless it is explicitly added
using !c01!f27' git add ...'!c15!f24 and the commit it using
!c01!f27'git commit....'!c15!f24
$SE

$SB
     The reverse of add is

$l
      !c01!f27'git rm <file> .... <file>'!c15!f24

$SL
5. !%One can create new branch using
!c01!f27' git branch <branch name>'!c15!f24 and can be moved to desired branch
using !c01!f27'git checkout <branch name>'!c15!f24.
$SE

$l
   Currently active branch and other branches can be seen by;
      !c01!f27'git branch'!c15!f24

$SL
6. !%One can merge a branch to current branch using
!c01!f27'git merge <branch name>'!c15!f24 . This will work if there
are no conflicts, for examples if  branches modified
same file and committed then a conflict will arise and it has to
be resolved manually.
The conflicts will be marked in the file and can be modified
using an editor.
Once conflicts are resolved manually, it can be committed
$SE

       !c01!f27'git commit -a -m "<commit message>"'!c15!f24

$o25
$SB
      However two different branches modified different files, it is
not a problem. Merging both to the master(or to any other branch)
will include the modifications from both.
$SE

$l
      eg.
$f27
$tc01
           git checkout master
           git merge branch1
           git merge branch2

$tc15
$f24
$SP
      Now master will have both modifications in branch1 and branch2
(provided they modify different files).
$SE

$SB
      Similar to adding files is the case of removing files. However if a
common file is removed from one branch and another branch
keeps it (and may be modified also) can lead to conflicts
on merging and has to be modified manually and then committed.
$SE

$o15
$SL
7. !%One can remove a branch by issuing;
$SE

$f27
$tc01
       'git branch -d < branch name> .....<branch name>'
$tc15
$f24
$o25

$SP
      This will work only if branches to be deleted are merged with
current branch.
In case one needs to delete a branch unconditionally, issue;
$SE
$o15
$f27
$tc01
        'git branch -D <branch-name>'
$tc15
$f24

$SL
8. !%git cloning
$SE
$SP
     Cloning is making exact copy of a repository from a remote or
another local repository.
This is a way of collaborating work or can be even a branching out.
It can be as issued as follows
$SE

$f27
$tc01
      'git clone <remote> <local_folder>'
$tc15
$f24
       or
$f27
$tc01
       'git clone <path to git repo> <local_folder>
$tc15
$f24

$SP
     Now the new user can modify the repo and commit it.
Any stage original repo can get the modifications of the
new repository by issuing;
$SE

       !c01!f27'git pull <new_repo>'!c15!f24
$o25
$SB
     The modifications of the new repo will be fetched and merged
with currently active branch of the original. However it
there are conflicts manual modifications may be required.

$SB
     Another option just to check the modification of the new
by the old is to fetch the new. ie;
$l
      !c01!f27'git fetch <new>'!c15!f24
     and one can check the modifications by issuing
       !c01!f27'git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD'!c15!f24

$o15
$SL
9. !%There is a concept of 'remote repository' which can be in the same
machine, another machine in local network or a cloud repository.
For transaction between local and remote one can use 'ssh' or 'https',
which git decides using the url.
One can have more than one remote repository.
If the need is to create a 'remote' in local network (ie same
machine or another machine in the local network) one may follow the
steps below.
$SE

$o25
$SL
     a. !%Create a new account for git admin in that machine, it may
an existing account also.
$SE
$SL
     b. !%login in to that machine  and create a new folder with
a meaningful name connecting the repository.

$SL
     c. !%go to the new folder and issue;
$SE
         !c01!f27'git init --bare'!c15!f24
$SL
     d. !%One may create the 'ssh' setting as explained earlier so
that batch ssh possible.
$SE
$SL
     e. !%come back to the original machine and move to the
git folder of interest. Make sure that one can ssh to
the 'remote'.
$SE
        Now issue;
          !c01!f27git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>!c15!f24
          eg.  !c01!f27git remote add origin git@192.168.1.20:myrepo!c15!f24
                  or
               !c01!f27git remote add gitorigin git@machine.name:myrepo!c15!f24
        again issue;
          !c01!f27git push -u <remote_name> master!c15!f24
$SB
        Cloud machines eg github.com, sourceforge.com etc provide
web interface to create  a new account, set up ssh/https etc
and initialize a new repository. Also they explain commands
to be issued locally which are very much similar as above.
$SE
$SB
        Any time the local version is modified, remote can be synced with
local with push.
$SE

$SB
        Others who need a copy of the repository can clone it.
$SE

        ie ; !c01!f27git clone <remote_url>!c15!f24

$SB
        if the remote is updated and local needs to sync with remote
$SE

           !c01!f27git pull <remote_url>!c15!f24
$o10
$SP
One can check the remotes by issuing;
$SE

           !c01!f27'git remote -v show'!c15!f24

$SP
Though it is possible for different users (if allowed) to push their
branches to a remote, it may also lead to conflicts. If such conflicts
occure it  may need to be
resolved  before pushing. This can be done by issuing a pull request, and care
should be taken in such cases.
